Email-GPT streamlines email management through a collaborative workflow involving multiple specialized AI agents. Here's how it works:
- Read and Summarize Email: The first AI agent reads the email and generates a concise summary.
- Generate Reply: The second AI agent creates a draft reply based on the summary and context.
- Check Reply: Another AI agent evaluates the draft for quality and accuracy.
- If the reply is acceptable, it moves to the next step.
- If not, the workflow enters a refinement phase.
- Rewrite Reply: An AI agent revises the email to address issues and improve clarity.
- Send Email: The final AI agent sends the completed email to the recipient.
This process ensures efficient, accurate, and professional email handling by leveraging the strengths of multiple AI agents working together.
